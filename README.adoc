== linebench

A collection of simple benchmarks for reading a text file line by line and
printing it.  The techniques used are supposed to be easy for each corresponding language/
environment. The results are surprising.

* C++ iostreams and std::getline()
* stdio gets/puts
* GNU readline
* A scanner generated by FLEX
* Python

== Building

It has only been tested under MacOSX but it is expected it will work without
any modification under Linux. Windows is not supported, though it could probably
work under Cygwin. Contributions improving portability are welcome.

It requires CMake v2.8 or later. To build, in the source directory:

----
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
----

Then to run, from within the +build+ directory we just created:

----
../run-bench.sh .. sample-input.txt
----

== Results

On a test machine:

|=======
| Method | time | factor
| C gets | 0.590s | 1x
| C++ iostreams | 0.295s | 0.51x
| FLEX scanner | 0.782s | 1.33x
| C GNU readline | 0.474s | 0.80x
| Python | 1.985s | 3.3x
| NodeJS | 1.089s | 1.86x
